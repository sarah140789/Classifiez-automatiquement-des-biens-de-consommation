🛍️ Automatic Classification of Consumer Goods 🛍️
Welcome to our project! 🎉

As a Data Scientist at "Place de marché," a company launching an e-commerce marketplace, your mission is to automate the classification of items into categories based on text descriptions and images provided by sellers. 📊

🚀 Project Goals:

Feasibility Study:

Analyze product descriptions and images to determine the feasibility of automatic category classification.
Preprocess text and image data.
Extract features from text and images.
Reduce dimensions and project products onto a 2D graph with colors corresponding to actual categories.
Visually and quantitatively analyze the feasibility of grouping products into the correct categories.
Feature Extraction:

Implement SIFT/ORB/SURF and CNN Transfer Learning for image feature extraction.
Implement simple word counting and Tf-idf for text feature extraction.
Use Word2Vec (or Glove or FastText) for classical word/sentence embedding.
Use BERT and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) for advanced word/sentence embedding.
Supervised Classification:

Perform supervised classification using image data.
Implement data augmentation to optimize the model.
Extend the product range to include fine foods by collecting "champagne" products via an API.
Deliverables:

A Python script/notebook for extracting the top 10 "champagne" products into a .csv file with relevant data fields.
A well-documented notebook with feature extraction, feasibility study, and supervised classification steps.
A presentation (up to 30 slides) summarizing the methodology and key analysis results.
Join us in this mission to enhance the user experience on "Place de marché" by automating product categorization! 🌍💡
